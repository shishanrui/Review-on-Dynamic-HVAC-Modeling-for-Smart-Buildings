# Curated Paper Lists for Dynamic HVAC Modeling in Smart Buildings

This repository accompanies the review paper:

**Review on dynamic HVAC modeling for smart buildings: advancing fault detection and diagnosis, control optimization, and demand-side energy flexibility**

It provides curated and structured paper lists used to support the systematic analysis and synthesis presented in the review.

The repository collects peer-reviewed studies on **dynamic modeling of HVAC systems in smart buildings**, with a focus on how dynamic models are constructed, calibrated, validated, and applied in different operational contexts.


## Paper groups

The repository contains **two complementary paper groups**, corresponding to different roles of dynamic models in the literature.

### Group 1: Dynamic models applied to operational tasks (181 papers)

This group includes **181 studies** that apply dynamic HVAC models to one or more of the following operational domains:

* **Control optimization (CO)**
* **Demand-side energy flexibility (EF)**
* **Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD)**

These papers form the core evidence base discussed in the main body of the review.
They are analyzed in terms of:

* Modeling paradigm and complexity
* Calibration and validation practices
* Control or diagnostic time scales
* Evaluation settings (simulation, laboratory, HIL, or real buildings)
* Deployment maturity and reported performance outcomes

### Group 2: Dynamic model development and related applications (184 papers)

This group includes **184 studies** that focus primarily on:

* Novel dynamic model formulations or identification methods
* Model structure development and validation
* Related applications such as system sizing, design, or offline analysis

These papers provide methodological foundations and contextual background but are **not the primary focus of the operational synthesis** in the review.
